## 港鐵替代路線查找器

This is the Repo of 港鐵替代路線查找器. The UI is built using HTML. The internal features such as pathfinding are all written using TypeScript and then compiled to JavaScript. This ensures that the JavaScript is, at very most of the time, free of any syntax errors.

Due to the limitation of GitHub Pages, all server-side code is disabled. This means that PHP and JSP files will not work.

This also means that the only thing that works is Javascript/TypeScript.

### Currently-completed features

- Route Search
- Path-finding
- Interchange suggestions
- Interchange concessions

### Features WIP

- Commuter Mode and Night Mode
- Travel time estimation
- Real-time countdown of lines

### Other Notes

We are currently looking for GitHub help! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests to enhance this web-app further.
